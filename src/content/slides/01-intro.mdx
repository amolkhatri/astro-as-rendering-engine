It ships **zero JavaScript by default** and uses a unique "Islands Architecture" 
to hydrate interactive components only when needed.

## Core Features

```js
const astro = {
  ship_js: false,           // Zero JavaScript by default
  hydration: "selective",   // Component Islands architecture  
  frameworks: ["react", "vue", "svelte", "qwik", "vanilla"],
  deploy: ["edge", "ssg", "ssr"],
  optimize: { images: true, fonts: true, assets: true }
};
```
